A calendar for a group to manage time
# Background 
Most of the existing calendar applications are made for personal usage. It is difficult to arrange a meeting for a group and see available time slots of everyone. Our team intent to develop a calendar application which designed to serve the need of a group. People are having hard time to set up group meetings since they do not know the schedule of other people in their group. With our application, everyone can post his or her schedule and sees the available time slots of others. Having this kind of application that keeps track of everyoneâ€™s schedule, users can save a plenty of time on setting up meetings and start their works smoothly. Also, project managers can manage the time frames and assign tasks to their group members efficiently.
